No software is non-testable, because all software are expected to have:

a known range of possible user input (e.g., numeric input, alphanumeric input, clicking widgets)
a consistent, repeatable process and condition (e.g., computation using a formula, a UI behavior based on user action, performing normal tasks during expected hours)
a predictable output based on the user input and conditions (e.g., an error/confirmation message, a landing page, a numerical output)
