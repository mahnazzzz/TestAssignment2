# Test Smell Examples

Provided below are examples of test smells that were detected in open source Android projects.


#### Assertion Roulette


##### Code Snippet

```java
    @MediumTest
    public void testCloneNonBareRepoFromLocalTestServer() throws Exception {
        Clone cloneOp = new Clone(false, integrationGitServerURIFor("small-repo.early.git"), helper().newFolder());

        Repository repo = executeAndWaitFor(cloneOp);

        assertThat(repo, hasGitObject("ba1f63e4430bff267d112b1e8afc1d6294db0ccc"));

        File readmeFile = new File(repo.getWorkTree(), "README");
        assertThat(readmeFile, exists());
        assertThat(readmeFile, ofLength(12));
    }
```

##### Rationale

The `assertThat()` method is called 3 times within the test method. Each assert statement checks for a different condition, but the developer does not provide a explanation message for each assert statement. Hence, if one of the assert statements were to fail, identifying the cause of the failure is not straightforward.
